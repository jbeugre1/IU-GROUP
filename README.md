## Abstract

This project consists of making a web application working with a database on the back-end. The goal of our project was to create a website to help IU member to socialize and create connection with each other. In the first part of this project, we decide what IU member may need and what we can offer with our website. In the second part, we tried to create the website with the feature we thought might help IU member and finally the last is where we were talking about the limit we face during this project.

1. MOTIVATION AND AIM OF THE WEBSITE 

1.1 Significance and motivation

The widespread usage of smartphones and mobile applications has had a huge impact not only on how people behave in the real world, but also on how groups of users engage with one another when arranging group events. Understanding how users make group event selections and understanding the elements that influence them can provide vital insights for social group research as well as more intelligent approach and software architecture for group event scheduling.
In this, we have designed a website for IU students who are able to register and login using their IU email ID. Our website enables the students to view the events and groups as well as join the groups and events and attend them as per their interest.

1.2 Problem Solving

We noticed, that contrary to high school, it’s tougher to create a connection with other students in college and we thought that he was a problem because college unlike other institution bring diversity and multiculturalism. Colleges also organize some recreative activities, but we believe that it’s not enough. So, to find a solution to help student meeting and making new friend with similar interest, we decide to create IU group.

1.3 Target audience

After a long brainstorming, we decided to choose IU students, staff members and professors as our target audience. We thought staff member and professor are also part of our Indiana university community since they joined students in some school activity. So, we thought they should be included in our target audience. However, we did not include people of Indianapolis because we thought that most the activities would occur on campus and since they would not have access to some building for example, we decide then to remove them from our target audience.

2. IU GROUP DESCRIPTION

IU Group allows Indiana University students to interact with one another, meet new people, and get involved. The site is designed to allow users to navigate freely through the site with minimal confusion. Initially, we created the site with many complexes features that the user may have trouble following through the site. To minimize complicated features, the site was illustrated on a piece of paper and thought carefully about how our design and functionality would look like.
The website was created while thinking of accessibility measures a user might face. For example, the background of the site was carefully reviewed and selected. Initially, the background color was a bit darker and consisted of solid black font with instructions. We figured this may challenge individuals with visual disabilities such as color blindness. To fix this issue, the background image was put in an application that allowed the developers to change the contrast and brightness of the image.

An unregistered user can see groups and events going on around the campus or off campus activities. The unregistered user cannot participate or sign up for those activities until they have created a profile. When a profile is created and the user successfully logs in, the user may see an additional tab that they can click on. Those new buttons are view my events, create event/groups, and join/event groups. They still have the initial options that an unregistered user sees as well. Those features include groups, events, and IU Group. The main page is IU Group. If the user wants to get a more descriptive information on what IU Group is and different features that are implemented, they can redirect to the IU Group page. When a user is registered, they also have access to event and group management. The user can manage their groups or events by simply pressing on their username on the top right hand of the page.

2.1 IU Group Registration & Login

The website is comprised of two buttons on the top right of the page. These buttons are login and register. If a new user wants to create an IU Group event, the user will first need to register to create the desired event. An event cannot be created unless the user is registered. We have not implemented a guest registration section for multiple reasons. The main reason is due to individual’s ability to access information outside of the university. IU Group is strictly designed for IU students, so they do not feel left out. This is what separates our project from any other social media site. To register, the user must use their IU email ID that is provided by the university, otherwise authentication would not be granted.
Once a user is registered, the user will be redirected to the log in page with missing input. The user will have to input their IU email ID along with the password that they have created. The discretion of saving the password information is up to the user. The site is designed this way to prevent user’s from forgetting their passwords. An email ID and password that is repeated could minimize forgetting information.
