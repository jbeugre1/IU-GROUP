## Abstract

This project consists of making a web application working with a database on the back-end. The goal of our project was to create a website to help IU member to socialize and create connection with each other. In the first part of this project, we decide what IU member may need and what we can offer with our website. In the second part, we tried to create the website with the feature we thought might help IU member and finally the last is where we were talking about the limit we face during this project.

1. MOTIVATION AND AIM OF THE WEBSITE 

    1.1 Significance and motivation

The widespread usage of smartphones and mobile applications has had a huge impact not only on how people behave in the real world, but also on how groups of users engage with one another when arranging group events. Understanding how users make group event selections and understanding the elements that influence them can provide vital insights for social group research as well as more intelligent approach and software architecture for group event scheduling.
In this, we have designed a website for IU students who are able to register and login using their IU email ID. Our website enables the students to view the events and groups as well as join the groups and events and attend them as per their interest.

1.2 Problem Solving

We noticed, that contrary to high school, it’s tougher to create a connection with other students in college and we thought that he was a problem because college unlike other institution bring diversity and multiculturalism. Colleges also organize some recreative activities, but we believe that it’s not enough. So, to find a solution to help student meeting and making new friend with similar interest, we decide to create IU group.

1.3 Target audience

After a long brainstorming, we decided to choose IU students, staff members and professors as our target audience. We thought staff member and professor are also part of our Indiana university community since they joined students in some school activity. So, we thought they should be included in our target audience. However, we did not include people of Indianapolis because we thought that most the activities would occur on campus and since they would not have access to some building for example, we decide then to remove them from our target audience.

2. IU GROUP DESCRIPTION

IU Group allows Indiana University students to interact with one another, meet new people, and get involved. The site is designed to allow users to navigate freely through the site with minimal confusion. Initially, we created the site with many complexes features that the user may have trouble following through the site. To minimize complicated features, the site was illustrated on a piece of paper and thought carefully about how our design and functionality would look like.
The website was created while thinking of accessibility measures a user might face. For example, the background of the site was carefully reviewed and selected. Initially, the background color was a bit darker and consisted of solid black font with instructions. We figured this may challenge individuals with visual disabilities such as color blindness. To fix this issue, the background image was put in an application that allowed the developers to change the contrast and brightness of the image.

An unregistered user can see groups and events going on around the campus or off campus activities. The unregistered user cannot participate or sign up for those activities until they have created a profile. When a profile is created and the user successfully logs in, the user may see an additional tab that they can click on. Those new buttons are view my events, create event/groups, and join/event groups. They still have the initial options that an unregistered user sees as well. Those features include groups, events, and IU Group. The main page is IU Group. If the user wants to get a more descriptive information on what IU Group is and different features that are implemented, they can redirect to the IU Group page. When a user is registered, they also have access to event and group management. The user can manage their groups or events by simply pressing on their username on the top right hand of the page.

2.1 IU Group Registration & Login

The website is comprised of two buttons on the top right of the page. These buttons are login and register. If a new user wants to create an IU Group event, the user will first need to register to create the desired event. An event cannot be created unless the user is registered. We have not implemented a guest registration section for multiple reasons. The main reason is due to individual’s ability to access information outside of the university. IU Group is strictly designed for IU students, so they do not feel left out. This is what separates our project from any other social media site. To register, the user must use their IU email ID that is provided by the university, otherwise authentication would not be granted.
Once a user is registered, the user will be redirected to the log in page with missing input. The user will have to input their IU email ID along with the password that they have created. The discretion of saving the password information is up to the user. The site is designed this way to prevent user’s from forgetting their passwords. An email ID and password that is repeated could minimize forgetting information.

2.2 GroupsandEvents

The groups and events page are simple yet have crucial information for a user to successfully join a group or a particular event. If a group is created, the user will see a table with five columns. The columns consist of Group Name, Group Topic, Group Creator, Number of Members, and Group Description. This allows a user to see what group is available and the quantity of seats available. The group will disappear once all seats are fulfilled. If the user is a part of a specific group, the user can access their group information by selecting their username.

Figure 1: A user's visualization when selecting IU Group's page.

In Figure 1, there are three groups a user may join. Two of those groups will be discussing books. The reason the user can see the quantity of seats available rather than “available” or “full” is to help users pick what they are most comfortable with. For example, if a user is more of an introvert, the user would probably be more comfortable with a smaller crowd than a larger crowd.
The event page is similar to the IU Group’s page. The event page consists of six columns. Those columns include Event ID, Event Name, Event Date, Event Hour, Event Place, and Event host. Our project was carefully developed. We made sure to eliminate any bugs and keep confusion at a minimal. If an event has passed, the event no longer displays on the event page. This eliminates any confusion, and the user can see the active events they have selected to attend. If you cannot attend an event or group, you can remove it in management page. If you are the host and cannot find a co-host to run your event in an emergency, you too can delete your event.



Figure 1.1: A host can delete their event if the host no longer wants to host the event.


In Figure 1.1, jj123 is the host of the science event. The host can delete the event which will delete off the IU Event’s page. The design of this website is to allow students to view events that are occurring the day of or a couple days in advance. We encourage the hosts to find co-hosts or delete an event a week in advance, so students or faculty do not show up to an event that no longer exists.

2.3 CreateandJoinGroupsorEvents

To create an event, the host will simply input information in the required fields. The required fields are the following:
• Event Name
• Event Date
• Event Hour
• Event Address

After all the information is inputted, the user is asked if there is a maximum number of participants. This
allows the user to control the environment of their event. If there is an unlimited number of participants, then the user will select from a drop-down menu and change true to false.

2.4 User Interaction

The user interacts with IU Group’s site by initially creating an account. If an account is not created the user may only view the events. The user scenario below is an example of how a user may interact with our site.
Samantha just graduated from a small high school in Kentucky. She will be attending IUPUI in the fall. She is nervous because all her friends have decided to stay local. After researching, Samantha has found IU Group and decides to sign up. She creates an account with her IU email ID and looks at upcoming events. She prefers to create her own for other students in the similar situations. Samantha does not want a large group to attend because she feels like students will come with other friends and it may be difficult to create a connection with the students.

Figure 1.2: User will need to hit the create button to create the friendship group.

Samantha will check her new group that is created by selecting the groups page. Samantha can keep track with how many individuals join their group by keeping an eye out on the number of members. There are many other ways a user may want to create a group, but this scenario displays the importance of our site and how a user may interact with our site to achieve their goal.

2.5 KeyFunctionalities

The key features and data to IU Group is crucial to gather the user’s attention. IU Group is comprised of a simple design and mapping that allows the user to understand how to navigate through the site successfully. We have included instructions on the register page for users that may not have experience registering to a site before. The instructions provided will ease the user’s ability to follow intuitive actions to use the site properly. The site is designed to attract a user by its appealing yet subtle colors. We have designed the background using HTML and CSS to make the site more appealing and transparent to people that could have visual impairments.
The key data that is used in IU Group’s site is linked to SQL. To ensure only present or future events display on the page, we have used SQL statements to avoid past events from appearing. SQL was useful for updating the user’s registration and ensuring the user meets the required age limit as well as having a valid university ID.

3. EXPLANATION OF PROJECT COMPONENTS 
3.1 Creationofdatabase

After choosing IU Group as project, the next step was building a database free of anomalies and redundancy. After a long brainstorming, we started to normalize our data tables and then design the final entity relationship diagram.

Figure 1: IU Group Entity Relationship Diagram

This diagram is simple to understand at first sight, but contain complex information. The main table in this database are the User, Group and Event tables. They are the principal entity our website needs to exist. The User table has basic attributes that we need to collect to identify a user. Those attributes are the Last Name, Username, Password and Date of birth. To make the difference between the different type of user, we created two sub table for the User Table.
The first table is USER_NORM which supposed to represent every IU student, professor or staff member. This table contains the registration Date, the number of group and number of groups created by a user which can be useful data if we want to do future research on IU member activity.
The other sub table is ADMIN which is just a table to define if the user is an admin of our website or not. The idea was to assign different role to admin and redirect them to a page that is designed to help them complete their tasks. We thought about role like data analysis who will receive filter data or role like staff member that will monitor and check if the website rules are respected.
The second main table is GROUP which is a simple table which has as attribute the group ID which assign automatically, the creator ID which indicate that we need to create a relation between the USER table and GROUP Table. We also have obvious attribute like the name of the group, the topic of the group, the number of user in the group and the maximum of Users the group can accept.
The final main table is the EVENT table which is the main purpose of our website. The event are the tools we want to use to create a connection between the people from IUPUI. The EVENT table like the GROUP table has an ID, a creatorID and a name attribute. The difference is that we need a date and place for the event that why we create the attribute Event_Date, Event Hour and Event Place. The last attribute is the Event Type. We wanted to separate the event to avoid from being submerged with a wave of events. So, we decide to create Event_Group and Event_Independent. Event group are event that the creator will send to every member of his group and Event Independent are event that any user can create without being a group creator.
Event_Group in particular have a link with group to allow action like delete on cascade.

2.2 Languages and/or tools did you use

We used various tools and language to make this project possible. The first and most important tool was PhpMyAdmin. PhpMyAdmin is a free tool that help programmer to manage their database. From our end, IUPUI provides us a phpMyAdmin account which is linked to a student server also provided by IUPUI. After that, we have PHP which is a scripting language that help building a dynamic website and act like a bridge between the server side and the client side. We also have HTML which is the structure of every web page, CSS which is a stylesheet used to style and lay out our web pages. And finally, we have JavaScript, which is a scripting language for client side only and mainly used for front end development unlike PHP which is used for back-end development

2.3 Project components Explanation

As explained before, the goal of our project was to connect people from Indiana University and the best strategy that we find was creating a website that will let students, staff or professor to create event of any type where they can meet each other to discuss, having fun and enjoying college life. To maintain a good environment for our website, we decide to let only the user who have an account to create those events which lead us to a login and register page.
The register page is basically a form that let user register their personal information such as the First name, Last name, username, IU email and Password. And since the form cannot prevent wrong value, we used PHP and MySQL to prevent our users to write wrong information susceptible to create bug in our system. For the email check, we used a query and the php function “stripos” to check if the email sent by the user contain “@iu.edu”. If the stripos function do not find the occurrence of “@iu.edu”, a script will send a popup box to let users know that they need to enter an IU Email. This was an alternative method to the account confirmation by email since we did not know how to send an email with the tool that we used for our project.
The second page was the login and it was easier to create than the register. The only problem that we face was the fact that the password was not case sensitive when we insert our password, but soon we realized that it was not from the form but from the query that check the password. So, we changed the query to: "select * from USER where U_Username ='$name' && BINARY U_Password = '$pass' ". The “BINARY” before the password is a query function that convert the password input to a binary string. So, the query will find the account only if the passwords match perfectly the password on the database. After that, it will create a session that will help us keeping the user connected.
The use of session helped us preventing some user to access some page they are not supposed to open. To make it possible we wrote a function that check if the user id that we create during the login exist. So, if condition is false, it will redirect the user to the login page. We also use the session to modify the bar title so that when users are connected, they can easy access to the page reserved to our website member.

Figure 2: Title Bar

As you can see from above, 5 new links appeared on our title bar after users successfully log in. We wrote a simple code to prevent users to use the 5 new links just by typing their link when they are not log in.

if (!isset($_SESSION["username"])){
     header("location: Login.html");
}


Since the session stores the username and the user ID of the account after the log in, we can check in each file if the session is set thanks to those values. On this basis, we had to start a session on every page that require a check to allow the check code above. Only the logout link doesn’t have this code because it destroys the session and unset the value with it.
The group and event page, are principally page that lets users see the group and event available by populating table with the database information. The two tables use the same logic with some differences. The table from the group page only shows groups with seat available, because in our database, the GROUP table has a number of users and a maximum number of user attributes. So, by comparing both in the query we could check if the group is full or not. On the other hand, the event table only presents the events with future date. To make it possible we use a date function to get the current date with the correct format to compare with the event date in our database. If the date of the event is today or in the future the users can see those event on the event page. So at the end, it likes an auto-update the list of events. The advantage is the fact we don’t need to delete the group and event to make the tables less busy. In addition to the date checker, the event page only shows the independent event. By independent, we mean that those events are not associated with a group.
Another important component is the createeventgroup page which is composed of two forms, letting users insert the information about their group or event. This page also has restriction like the registration page preventing user to enter a passed date for example. Each form redirects to a PHP file with an insert query which we put the information in our database.
The jointable page was the result of the trouble we face after looking for a way to make joined button after each row. So, we decide to make a search.

Figure 3: Join page different step

As we can see in the figure 3, the join page works in two steps. The first step is searching an event or group by typing the complete name or a part of the name of the group or Event. Then the user has to select if what he is looking for is a group or event. After that, when the user click on the search button, a dropdown menu appear with all the matches and the user just have to choose and click on add. The name of each option of the dropdown is the ID of the Group or Even which made the insertion of the event or group easier for the query we want to use.
Contrary to the event page, the View Event page shows all types of events as long as the user is registered for this event. In addition to the table that we build we create a search bar to delete the events, but realized that I won’t be easy for the user to look every time for the Event ID to delete the event. So, we decide to go with a drop down that we let the user decide which event he want to de delete. The only similarity that it has with the event table is that it doesn’t show past date event.
The last component of our project is the profile. This page serves as a management page for the users. It is from this page that users can add events for their group that will be sent to all the members of those groups. Since we have a table link between user and group, we have just had to insert the group id with the user id on this table to make the event available to the members. We also have the possibility to quit someone group or even delete the group we created. After quitting a group, the code gets all the event of this group and delete all the link between those events and the userID. But when we delete a group, it’s automatic because the group_event table has a foreign key that link it to the group table. So, it will delete all the events on cascade when we will delete a group. From this page we also have the list of all our groups with the description and the number of seats available.
